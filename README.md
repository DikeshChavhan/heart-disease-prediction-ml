# 💓 Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease using a trained ML model on the UCI Heart Disease dataset.

## 🚀 Project Overview
- Data: UCI Heart Disease Dataset
- Goal: Predict whether a person has heart disease based on medical features
- Algorithms Tested: Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM
- Best Model: Random Forest (highest accuracy)

## 🧠 Features
- User-friendly Streamlit web app
- Real-time prediction based on input values
- Saved model (`best_model.pkl`) for reuse
